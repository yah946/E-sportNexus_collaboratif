# Project Title: Esport

This project aims to modernize an existing platform by making it **fully responsive**, **highly interactive**, and ensuring an **engaging user interface** with improved navigation across all devices.

---

## Project Objective

The core goal is to update the platform, focusing on **responsiveness** and **interactivity**. This includes delivering a better navigational experience and a more engaging UI. The site must be fully adaptive to different screen sizes using defined **breakpoints** and incorporate advanced interactive components to enrich the user experience.

## Very Important Guidelines

### Collaborative Work & Integrity

* **Collaboration is Key:** The work must be **collaborative**. Each learner must develop a minimum of **five (5) components**. Task distribution must be equitable.
* **AI Restriction:** The use of **generative AI tools** is **strictly forbidden** for both code and design.
* **Compliance:** Any non-compliance with these rules will result in the **invalidation of the brief** for the entire squad.

## Key Features & Technologies

| Feature | Description | Technology/Tool |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Responsiveness** | Fully adaptive site for optimal experience on all devices. | HTML, CSS (Media Queries) |
| **Prototyping** | High-fidelity, interactive mockups to validate the UI and design. | Figma |
| **Interactivity** | Integration of components: modals, dropdowns, carousels. Unified and **modular** `script.js` for reusability and maintenance. | Modular JavaScript, HTML, CSS |
| **Forms Validation** | **Real-time form validation** for intuitive error handling and clear user messages. | Parsley.js |
| **Performance & Accessibility** | Optimized loading times and adherence to **WCAG** standards for all interactive features. | Image/Resource Optimization, WCAG Compliance |

### Technical Recommendations

* Use **relative units** (`rem`, `em`, and percentages).
* **Optimize** images and other resources.
* **Document** the code well.
* Technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (already integrated).
