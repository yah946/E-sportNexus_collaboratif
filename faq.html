            <h1>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
        </div>
    
    
        <h4>Can I stream or create videos of your games? And is it okay if I monetise them?</h4>
    
    
        <p>You sure can - we love it when you do! Esport Nexus hereby grants free license - to game owners and press - to use our games in the creation and publishing (or streaming) of original media content, including reviews, gameplay videos and Let's Plays. Esport Nexus also grants free license to content creators to monetise these works, whether through advertising, stream donations, or otherwise.</p>
    
    
        <h4>Can I sell Hollow Knight or Hollow Knight: Silksong merchandise?</h4>
    
        <div class="unique-p">
            <p>Seeing people create original works based on our games is fantastic, and we're generally okay with people selling fan-merch they've made in small batches or as one-offs. But! To keep things fair, we do have the following rules:</p>
        
        
            <ul>
                <li>individuals creating and selling one-off or small batches of items for sale is okay. We do NOT give license to private businesses to sell merchandise based on Hollow Knight or any other future Esport Nexus properties.</li>
                <li>Making and selling original items that you designed and made yourself, based on the world or characters of Hollow Knight, is extremely fine. However, we don't give permission for anyone to use graphics from in the game or official marketing materials created by us - even if you add a scratchy texture to it in Photoshop or whatever. This includes character art, wallpapers, spritework etc etc created by us here at Esport Nexus.</li>
                <li>We don't allow the sale of merchandise or digital works based on Hollow Knight, or any other future property, on mass distribution sites such as Redbubble.</li>
                <li>We don't allow crowd-funding campaigns related to our games, or any other future Esport Nexus properties. This includes sites like Kickstarter, Patreon, etc.</li>
                <li>We don't allow anyone to display the trademarked terms “Hollow Knight” or “Esport Nexus” on their fan-merchandise. That's because we use those logos on our own partnered merch to let people know it's official!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    
    
    
        <h4>Can I donate to the Hollow Knight Kickstarter campaign and become a backer?</h4>
    
        <p>We're no longer taking any donations for the Hollow Knight Kickstarter campaign - it was a huge, huge success and thanks to the support of our backers Hollow Knight has now been developed and released on multiple platforms. We definitely appreciate the offer though! If you want to help out, you can always gift a copy of the game to a friend ;</p>
    
        <h4>Are there any internships, paid positions or work-experience opportunities open at Esport Nexus?</h4>
    
        <p>Not at the moment, sorry! We like to keep the team pretty small, and unfortunately we don't often have the spare time to take on interns. If an opening does come up, we'll let everyone know here on the site and on social media.</p>
    
        <h4>What do you use to make games?</h4>
    
        <p>We use Unity to build games for all platforms, utilising assets like PlayMaker, TextMesh Pro and 2d Toolkit from the asset store - find out more here! All the art assets from the games, including animations, were drawn in Photoshop. The Hollow Knight prototype was developed using Stencyl - give it a try if you want to learn how to make games yourself!</p>
